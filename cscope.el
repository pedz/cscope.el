;;; cscope.el --- emacs interface to cscope

;; This is a ground up review and rewrite of code that I originally
;; wrote while contracting at Tandem (in Austin).
;; Tue Dec  3 08:25:25 CST 2013

;; This was written by Perry Smith (a.k.a. pedz) at Tandem 
;; Thu Jul 26 10:32:36 CDT 1990

;; I work in an environment that runs an old copy of cscope but other
;; versions of cscope exist at the same time.  The environment also
;; has pre-built databases for different cross sections of the files.
;; Thus, the cscope database is rarely called 'cscope.out' nor is it
;; usually at the top of the source tree.  I also work in support so I
;; am frequently looking at different versions of the same file at the
;; same time.  The features of this cscope.el are to address these
;; needs.
;; 
;; The first feature of this cscope start with using `inherit' which
;; is a package that introduces the concept of inherited buffer local
;; variables see `make-variable-buffer-inherited'.  When buffer 2 is
;; create while in buffer 1, the inherited variables of buffer 2 are
;; initialized from the current values of buffer 1.  This provides the
;; ability to have groups of buffers that know their ancestary which
;; in tern allows to have multiple cscopes running at the same time
;; and the buffers created from one cscope know to use the cscope for
;; that buffer.  For example, a user can be looking at code in version
;; A and version B at the same time and the cscope searches know that
;; if searches while visiting a file from version A to use the cscope
;; running for version A.  The hook to do this is tied in to
;; `get-buffer-create' so a `grep' or `dired' done while visiting a
;; file from version A still knows to go back to the cscope for
;; version A if a subsequent search is done.
;;
;; The second feature is the cscope executable, the options to pass to
;; cscope, the top level directory of where the cscope thinks it was
;; cretaed, and the full path to the cscope database (and thus its
;; name) are four separate values are easily set for each cscope that
;; is started.  The user can create patterns that match the directory
;; of the file being edited and thus determine defaults for the four
;; values.  The user can also create functions such as "cscope-happy"
;; that starts the cscope for the Happy project without further
;; interaction.
;;
;; There is one "inherited" buffer which is `cscope-obarray'.  All the
;; buffers that should use a particular cscope process will have their
;; buffer local value of `cscope-obarray' pointing to the same
;; obarray.  This is accomplished through the `inherit' package.
;; Within `cscope-obarray' is a set of symbols (variables) that are
;; assigned when the cscope process is started.  One example is the
;; variable `cscope-out-buffer' which will not exist in the global
;; obarray but will be in `cscope-obarray'.  Three functions will be
;; created (in the global obarray): the function `cscope-out-buffer'
;; which will return the symbol interned in `cscope-obarray', the
;; function `cscope-out-buffer-get' which will return the value of the
;; symbol and `cscope-out-buffer-set' which will set the value of the
;; symbol.
;;
;; I think of `cscope-obarray' as an instance of an object and the
;; variables in it as attributes within the object.  All the buffers
;; using the same set of values for the cscope process, output buffer,
;; etc will point to the same `cscope-obarray' "instance".

The nine search facilities that CScope provides need to be called
from a key sequence, a mouse event, or from a menu.  This macro allows
a single definition to provide the three different functions.

NAME is the base name for the functions to define.  \"cscope-\"
will be prepended to NAME to provide the kbd event driven
version, \"cscope-mouse-\" for the mouse event driven version,
and \"cscope-menu-\" for the menu driven version.

SYMBOL is the type of the single argument that the kbd driven version
accepts.

DOC is the doc string without any ending period for the kbd
driven function.  This will be modified slightly for the other
two versions.

STR is the digit string, e.g. \"0\" to prepend to what is sent to the
cscope process.

PROMPT is the prompt that the kbd event version uses to prompt for the
string.

The mouse driven version will place point at the start of the mouse
event and then search for the symbol found under the point.  The menu
driven version simply search for the symbol found under the current
location of the point."
